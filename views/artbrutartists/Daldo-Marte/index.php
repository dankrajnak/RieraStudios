			<p>Daldo was extremely shy since he was a little child. He was diagnosed with a slight mental disability but it seems his mother had never accepted this diagnosis. She doesn’t talk much about his medical condition. She has always given him all her support and care, and as a teacher she took care of his education at home. During Daldo’s childhood and adolescence, he began to make his own toys. First, he used paper, then cardboard, and finally he found a unique way to create his toys. He started using the inner tubes of rubber from old car tires to develop a great diversity of little forms: animals, humanoids, spaceships and all kind of creatures from his own fantasy world and from his preferred comic series and cartoons. Some of them are just cut out with a scissor and with incredible precision from the rubber while others are ensemble using different independent pieces that he cut out separately to create a tridimensional figure. He also makes armors like the ones superheroes use. He makes them with recycled cardboard boxes and plastic, and once he finished one he wears it and walk through the streets of his neighborhood. His mother told he is more sociable at those moments. It is like his armors give him enough protection to get out fearless. In one occasion, Daldo made a raft using recycled plastic bottles. He still keeps it and sometimes he used it to jump into the coast near his home as a ship captain.      <br/></p>
