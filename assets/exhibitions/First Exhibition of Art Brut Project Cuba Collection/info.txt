Words on catalogue
Art Brut Project Cuba is an art project created by RIERA STUDIO with the purpose of promoting and supporting singular art expressions, that share a stylistic distance from the existing visual culture based on academic or intellectual training; and whose makers have no knowledge of intellectual artistic issues. Art made within this context and usually gathered under the related categories of Art Brut and Outsider Art, each one with its own conceptual characteristics but with dashing boundaries in between, are the scope of our project. 
Art Brut Project Cuba is actually the only Cuban art project specialized in these forms of visual art and it brings together the biggest collection of Cuban Art Brut and Outsider Art. Its main task is the acknowledgment and promotion of the Cuban creators of these types of art and their artworks, in the national and international scenes. Many of these artists have severe mental illnesses or difficult health and living conditions, and in many cases are a burden for their families. Thus, one of our most important goals is their recognition by their families as artistically creative individuals and to help them to be more independent.
