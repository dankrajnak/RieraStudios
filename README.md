# RieraStudios

A website currently being developed for Riera Studios based in Havana, Cuba.  The website is meant for museums, individuals, and studios outside of Cuba to learn about and experience the art in the studio.  


##Built from scratch

This is my first time building a website and I did it completely from scratch.  I didn't know about static-site generators, so I used a custom php framework to include partials like the navbar and footer on every page. The interactive element on the front page and (almost) all of the css are mine as well.  I also created scripts to generate HTML pages from a central repository of artist information and pictures.  There's probably a few bugs, and some of it may not make complete sense, but give me some slack, it's my first!

##TODO
* Make mobile-compatible
	* Reorganize and resize navbar
		* Add click feature through javascript instead of CSS
		* Organize so the navbar fits in 800px
	* Change CSS into LESS?
	* Use Bootstrap to ensure appropriate sizing?

* Minimize and combine javascript and css
	* Create gulp file?
