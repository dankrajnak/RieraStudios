# RieraStudios

A website currently being developed for Riera Studios based in Havana, Cuba.  The website is meant for museums, individuals, and studios outside of Cuba to learn about and experience the art in the studio.  


##Built from scratch

This is my first time building a website and I did it completely from scratch.  It was a very long process, and it could have been more efficient, but I learned a lot about web development that I would not have otherwise learned.  I didn't know about static-site generators, so I used a custom php framework to include partials like the navbar and footer on every page. The interactive element on the front page and (almost) all of the css are mine as well. I used Bootstrap to help make the page responsive.  I also created scripts to generate HTML pages from a central repository of artist information and pictures.  There's probably a few bugs, and some of it may not make complete sense, but give me some slack, it's my first!

##Problems to be tackled in the future:

* Optimization for Chrome, which limits javascript causing the homepage to move very slowly.
* More accurate search for matching artist names on exhibition pages.
* Search Engine Optimization, including relevant meta-tags.
